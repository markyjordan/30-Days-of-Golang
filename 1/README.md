# Day 1

The goal for Day 1 was to install Go and learn to write, compile, and run a
simple Go program.

## Notes

After navigating to the directory containing the Go file, compile the file by
running the ```go build``` command followed by the name of the Go file:
```
go build hello-world.go
```
This will create an executable file with the same name as the Go file (in this
case, 'hello-world') in the current directory.

Next, run the executable by typing it's name and pressing enter:
```
./hello-world
```
Alternatively, you can use the ```go run``` command to compile and run the Go
file in one step. To do this, simply run the following command in the directory
where your Go file is located:
```
go run hello-world.go
```
This will run the Go program, showing its output in the terminal.
